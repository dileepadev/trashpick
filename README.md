## ✨ About

The **TrashPick** mobile app is designed to guide people on how to properly dispose of waste. Users can register as a Trash Picker or Trash Collector. Trash Pickers can post details about trash disposal and they can sell their trash to Trash Pickers. Trash Collectors can buy it from Trash Pickers and sell it to recycling centers. Both users have a chance to earn points and win rewards by using this app. The TrashPick project has been developed with the Ethugalpura Pioneers' District Rover Crew. This alpha release does not include the complete requirements and interface. **This project has been developed as an open source for educational purposes.**
